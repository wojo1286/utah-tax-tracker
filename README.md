Utah Tax Distribution Tracker

This repository automates collecting monthly Utah tax‐distribution data (PDF format) for Transient Room, Sales & Use, Restaurant, and Resort Communities taxes, filters it for Moab City and Grand County, and loads the results into a Google Sheet. A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow keeps the sheet up‑to‑date.
